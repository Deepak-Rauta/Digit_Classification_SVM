🖌️ Digit Classification using SVM

This project is a digit classification web app built using Support Vector Machine (SVM). 

It allows users to upload an image of a handwritten digit (0-9), preprocess it, and predict the digit using a trained SVM model. 

The model is trained on the load_digits dataset from sklearn.
