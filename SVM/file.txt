work of openCV in this code:-

In Streamlit app, OpenCV (cv2) is used for image preprocessing before passing it to the trained SVM model. 
Let's break down its role:

ðŸ”¹ OpenCV (cv2) Usage in our Code
ðŸ“Œ 1. Reading the Uploaded Image
When a user uploads a digit image, OpenCV reads it into a NumPy array:

file_bytes = np.asarray(bytearray(image.read()), dtype=np.uint8)
img = cv2.imdecode(file_bytes, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
ðŸ”¹ cv2.imdecode() converts the raw bytes into an OpenCV grayscale image.

ðŸ“Œ 2. Resizing the Image to Match the Dataset Format
The load_digits dataset in sklearn has 8Ã—8 images, so we resize the uploaded image accordingly:
img = cv2.resize(img, (8, 8))
ðŸ”¹ This ensures that the image dimensions match the SVM model input.

ðŸ“Œ 3. Normalizing Pixel Values
The digits dataset in sklearn represents pixel intensity between 0-16, so we transform the uploaded image accordingly:
img = 16 - (img // 16)
ðŸ”¹ This converts pixel values from 0-255 (grayscale) to 0-16, matching the training dataset.

ðŸ“Œ 4. Displaying the Preprocessed Image in Streamlit
st.image(img, caption="Resized Image", width=150)
ðŸ”¹ This allows users to see the processed 8Ã—8 image before prediction.

ðŸš€ Final Thought
OpenCV acts as a bridge between raw uploaded images and the trained SVM model 
by ensuring the correct format, size, and pixel range before making predictions.
